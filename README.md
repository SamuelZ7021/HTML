## 📖 General Description

This repository documents my learning and practice process in frontend development. Here you'll find a collection of static websites, clones of popular interfaces, landing pages, and layout exercises that demonstrate mastery of **HTML5** structure and **CSS3** styling.

The goal is to showcase the evolution from basic structures to complex designs with multiple sections, forms, and navigation.
